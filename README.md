**🌟 KarmaToken.sol**


KarmaToken.sol is a decentralized, non-transferable (soulbound) token that represents reputation or karma points in a blockchain ecosystem.
Only registered platforms and the contract owner can mint (award) or revoke karma, ensuring a trusted and fair reward system.

**⚙️ Overview**

The KarmaToken system is designed for platforms that want to reward users for positive actions.

Karma points are non-transferable, meaning they cannot be sent or sold — they are soulbound.

Platforms can register to award karma.

Owner (admin) manages platform registration and can revoke karma if needed.

Fully on-chain transparency ensures fairness and immutability.

**🚀 Features**

✅ Soulbound Tokens — Karma is non-transferable.
✅ Owner-Controlled Platforms — Only verified platforms can award karma.
✅ Batch Minting — Award karma to multiple users at once.
✅ Daily Limit Enforcement — Platforms can have daily award limits.
✅ Revocation Support — Karma can be revoked by owner or platforms.
✅ Event Logging — All actions emit events for tracking and analytics.
